# hey, i'm nathan 🧰

i build tools that replace the clipboard-and-prayer workflows people put up with in offices, and i usually end up knee-deep in the infrastructure around them too.

most of my work lives in internal repos — automation, document processing, OCR pipelines, medical imaging, and operational tooling for environments where nothing talks to anything else and "just use a SaaS" isn't an option. i'm often the person diagnosing why a workflow broke before i'm the one building the thing that fixes it.

### 🔨 what i actually build

📄 **document processing** — batch ocr, pdf compression, image pipelines, and classification tools for legal/medical workflows — built around the actual hardware, network paths, and legacy software they have to survive in.

🏥 **medical imaging** — dicom viewers, study aggregators, and x-ray processing tools that handle the gap between clinical systems and what people actually need to do with the data.

🖥️ **desktop apps** — electron + react + python tools that run locally, deploy internally, and don't need a login screen. usually backed by fastapi with embedded python servers.

⚙️ **operational automation** — connecting systems that weren't designed to talk to each other, stabilizing processes that keep breaking, and replacing the manual glue that holds production workflows together.

📊 **dashboards** — internal performance tracking, employee metrics, and operational reporting without spinning up a whole bi platform.

🔧 **small sharp utilities** — file renaming, format conversion, record lookups, folder monitoring, archive management — the stuff that saves 20 minutes a day and no one thinks to automate.

### 🌱 currently

building full-stack desktop apps with electron, react, and typescript on the frontend paired with python/fastapi backends. still fighting windows packaging. losing gracefully.
